# Notes

## Hi, thank you for taking the time to review this

* I decided that using redux, or equivalent, would be overkill for state management.
* I concentrated on the functional aspects, ignoring styling.
* I Purposefully only wrote two test specs, to give you an idea of how I test.
* I'm not experienced with hooks, or using react-testing-library. So I used this as a learing exercise. Consequently it took me longer than the two hours.

## Moving forward, if this were production code I would, in no particular order

* run the linter.
* refactor the fetch data code and input field into a reusable component that could be bound to any endpoint (it's not very testable as is).
* Look at adding Styled Components.
* Rejig the file structure so each component, test spec and style file lived in it's own directory.
* Increase the test coverage.
